Oana Ivan

We should mention first about Oana, that she was raised and educated in a French style culture system(Romania modernized the education system in mid XIX century with French support and assistance).

Then, attracted by the French life style and culture, she moved to Paris and graduated several prestigious schools…

Since childhood she developed a preference for fine arts but she started her working life in a very challenging moment of Romania - the accession in the European Union(process benefiting of a strong support from France during President Chirac) working in Central Administration - Ministry of Finance, where she was a young member of the team in charge with managing of the EU funds…
   Then, she used her “money management” skills in the private sector, assisting very successfully several corporations in accessing European financing.
   At this new stage of her life, with a gain of financial comfort plus an interesting networking in different sectors, Oana decided to move to Paris.

After this important step in her life, feeling the need to get closer to her teenage passion - fine arts and media domain - she successfully founded, invested, created, managed the art and life style publication  “Frame Book Magazine”, as Owner and Editor in Chief, with physical presence in Paris, New York and Los Angeles.

In all these years she was constantly attracted by the contemporary, modern arts and, with a same “blood” in culture heritage like Brancusi or Brauner, she gets closer to today phenomenon in this domain, developing herself in studying the links between the Romanian and French culture in the field of “belle-arte” in our modern and sometimes “crazy world”, trying to introspect the state of mind of yesterday and today artists…
